The logic for the LDAP_UPDATE_TABLES procedure can be summarized in the following way.

There are 4 stages of the procedure:

1. Update or Insert into NCAP_USERS:
    It uses a MERGE statement to synchronize NCAP_USERS with ARP_USERS.
    If a match is found between NCAP_USERS and ARP_USERS based on gpn_code, it updates the user_name in NCAP_USERS.
    If no match is found and the gpn_code is not already in NCAP_USERS, it inserts a new row.

2. Update or Insert into NCAP_USER_ROLES:
    It iterates through each row from ARP_USER_ROLES.
    For each row, it checks whether a gpn + role pair exist in NCAP_USER_ROLES by invoking functions checkIfRoleExists function.
    For each row, it checks whether a gpn exist in NCAP_USERS checkIfGroupExists function.
    Based on the checks, it either inserts a new row or updates an existing row in NCAP_USER_ROLES.

3. Delete from NCAP_USER_ROLES:
    Deletes all rows from NCAP_USER_ROLES that do not have corresponding entries in ARP_USER_ROLES.

4. Delete from NCAP_USERS:
    Deletes all rows from NCAP_USERS that do not have corresponding entries in ARP_USERS.
